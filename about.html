		<h1>What Is This?</h1>
		<p>After doing alot of reading/following tutorials, I realized that I wasn't really learning because at the end I had never made anything and over time just forgetting the material I was putting in my head.<br><br> I decided that in order to really learn, it would be best to actually create things, so I set myself on the challenge to create something different everyday and watch my skill/knowledge progress as days go by.
